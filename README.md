# Philippine's Elderly Population Data Projection Analysis Publication

The Philippines is projected to achieve "aging society" status by 2030, with the population aged 60 and over expanding to 23.7 million by 2050. This demographic shift undermines the structural viability of the Social Security System (SSS) and Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) as the old-age dependency ratio doubles, reducing the number of active contributors relative to beneficiaries. Actuarial data indicates that the SSS faces asset depletion by the 2040s, necessitating aggressive policy interventions such as increased contributio2n rates and extended retirement ages to prevent systemic collapse. For future generations, this imbalance mandates a heightened fiscal burden through taxation and reduced public service funding, coupled with an increased domestic caregiving load that threatens to lower labor force participation and catalyze long-term economic stagnation.
