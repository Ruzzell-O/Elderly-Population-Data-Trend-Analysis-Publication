# Demographic Transition and Pension System Sustainability in the Philippines: A Data Projection Analysis

### Abstract

The Philippines is undergoing a significant demographic transition characterized by declining fertility rates and a projected increase in the elderly population. This shift alters the age-dependency ratio, placing unprecedented financial strain on the national pension infrastructure, specifically the Social Security System (SSS) and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). This analysis utilizes quantitative data projections to evaluate the long-term sustainability of the current "pay-as-you-go" and defined-benefit models.

Key variables include longitudinal fertility trends, life expectancy increases, and labor market participation rates. Projections indicate that as the working-age population diminishes relative to retirees, the solvency of existing fund reserves will face critical depletion risks. The findings suggest that current contribution rates and retirement age thresholds are insufficient to maintain benefit levels without substantial fiscal intervention. The study concludes with data-driven requirements for policy adjustments, focusing on contribution scaling, retirement age indexed to life expectancy, and the necessity of diversifying pension funding mechanisms to mitigate the impact of the demographic deficit.
